Very simple Umbraco based youtube playlist importer.

Things to point out : 
- Youtube playlist importer triggers on Playlist Item Saved event - this isn't a great idea and if there was more time allowed this would have been implemented in a different way.
- front end - only playlist url will display content (url available from umbraco backoffice on selected playlist)
- front end is very basic, without any styles
